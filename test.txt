The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na
Drugs, gimme drugs, gimme drugs
I don't need it, but I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill 'em all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator
